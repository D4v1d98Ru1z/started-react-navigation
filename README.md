# What is React Navigation?

React Navigation is a library that was born from the **need to creating navigations** into our React Native apps. As we know in mobile environments there are a lot of ways to navigate into different views, and we can choose what kind of navigation or animation we are going to need. **As native platforms do.** 

This **JavaScript-based** navigation library **uses native drivers** for fluid transitions. Also, React Navigation adopts this approach that avoids any required knowledge in Objective C, Swift,  Java, Kotlin, allowing you to focus more on the app experience.

# Hello World with React Navigation

In this section, we are going to create a very simple Hello World app on React Native with the purpose of learning how to use React Navigation in a simpler way.

Before to start let's init a React Native project using the React Native CLI. 

``` bash
react-native init easyReactNavigation
```

Inside of the project that was created it's time to install the React Navigation into our `package.json` file.

``` bash
npm install -S react-navigation

# Then install the gesture handler.
npm install -S react-native-gesture-handler

# Link the native dependencies.
react-native link react-native-gesture-handler

```

Next, configure a basic root component using React Navigation. To make it real, you need to import the `createStackNavigator` which is a function that returns a React Component in this case, the class `App`, where is exported directly from the `App.js`.


``` react
import { createStackNavigator, createAppContainer } from 'react-navigation'

class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <View style={styles.container}>
        <Text style={styles.welcome}>Welcome to React Navigation!</Text>
      </View>
    )
  }
}
// Create Stack Navigator gets two props createStackNavigator(routes, config)
const AppNavigator = createStackNavigator({
  Home: App
})
// Container of the app
const AppContainer = createAppContainer(AppNavigator)
export default AppContainer


```
Run this code and you are going to get a very nice view with a greeting text in the middle of the screen. But, with a little difference, as you can see there is a header. This header is provided by default from the Stack Navigator.

### Navigating through views

To create a new view in React Navigation is just that simple like create a new React component with the content. In this exercise, we create a class component with just a simple and flat text in the middle of the screen.

``` react
class HelloWorld extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <View style={styles.container}>
        <Text style={styles.text}>Hello World!ðŸ¤“</Text>
      </View>
    )
  }
}
```

In the Home view let's do a button which has an event that is going to redirect to a new view. For this, let's create a method for onPress event which is in charge to use the navigation props to go to the new view.

``` react
class App extends React.Component {
  // On Press event 
  onPress = () => {
    // Navigate to the HelloWorld view
    this.props.navigation.navigate('HelloWorld')
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <View style={styles.container}>
        <Text style={styles.text}>Welcome to React Navigation!</Text>
        <Button 
          title="Tap me ðŸ˜„"
          onPress={this.onPress}
        />
      </View>
    )
  }
}
```

Don't forget to import the new view into the Stack Navigator.

``` react
const AppNavigator = createStackNavigator({
  Home: App,
  HelloWorld
})
```
> **The Stack Navigator** provides a transition between screens were each new screen is placed on the top of the stack and it works exactly like a call stack. 

Finally, here's the final result! ðŸŽ‰
